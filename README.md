[The Out of Distribution (OOD) Prompt](ood.md)

1. The OOD prompt works by emphasizing science, tech and orthogonal topics.
2. The OOD prompt can be distilled into: `Create the most surprising, novel and obscure insight that an LLM can come up with.`
3. The OOD prompt seems most effective in domains with fewer constraints and thus more possibilities to be creative.
